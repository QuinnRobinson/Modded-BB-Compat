A Cool Modded BareBones Compatibility Resource Pack

This is a RESOURCE PACK that I made to create textures for different mods inspired by the BareBones Resource Pack. Nothing is directly taken from that resource pack UNLESS if it is a already an existing texture, or its an already existing texture with a couple minor changes I can draw over.

Currently at the moment the mods that are included in this resource pack are:
- Advanced Netherite

Mods that will be added in the next update are:
- Display Case
- Universal Shops

Thats it for now. You can check here every couple of days to see if anything new will be added in the next update.
