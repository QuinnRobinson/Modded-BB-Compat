A Cool Modded BareBones Compatibility Resource Pack

This is a RESOURCE PACK that I made to create textures for different mods inspired by the BareBones Resource Pack. Nothing is directly taken from that resource pack UNLESS if it is a already an existing texture, or its an already existing texture with a couple minor changes I can draw over.

I WILL NOT make textures towards mods that have already been textures by others. This includes:
- Detail Armor Bar
- Eating Animations
- Clown Scythe
- Fresh Animations
- Create
- Origins
- Deeper and Darker
- Daggers
- Friends & Foes
- More Mob Variants
- End Remastered
- You're in Grave Danger
- Snow Real Magic
- Backpacked
- Exposure
- Runes
- Spell Engine
- Wizards
- Jewelry
- Extended Drawers
- Abstract
- Waystones

Currently at the moment the mods that are included in this resource pack are:
- Advanced Netherite

Mods that will be added in the next update are:
- Display Case
- Universal Shops

Thats it for now. You can check here every couple of days to see if anything new will be added in the next update.
