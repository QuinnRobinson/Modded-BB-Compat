**A Cool Modded BareBones Compatibility Resource Pack**

This is a RESOURCE PACK that I made to create textures for different mods inspired by the BareBones Resource Pack. Nothing is directly taken from that resource pack UNLESS if it is already an existing texture, or its an already existing texture with a couple minor changes I can draw over.

**I WILL NOT make textures towards mods that have already been textures by others. This includes:**
- Detail Armor Bar
- Eating Animations
- Clown Scythe
- Fresh Animations
- Create
- Origins
- Deeper and Darker
- Daggers
- Friends & Foes
- More Mob Variants
- End Remastered
- You're in Grave Danger
- Snow Real Magic
- Backpacked
- Exposure
- Runes
- Spell Engine
- Wizards
- Jewelry
- Extended Drawers
- Abstract
- Waystones

Currently at the moment the mods that are included in this resource pack are:
- Advanced Netherite

Mods that will be added in the next update are:
- Display Case
- Universal Shops

Thats it for now. You can check here every couple of days to see if anything new will be added in the next update. (Updates will be listed below.)

**UPDATE V1.1.0**
- Added Display Case
- Removed Universal Shops From Production (Its A Head Item So I Cant Texture It Specifically)
- Added Netherite Extras
- Added Bountiful
